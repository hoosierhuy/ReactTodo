The obligatory todo app.

Mine uses Google's Firebase No-Sql database. Users log into the app using their own GitHub account and will have access to their own Todos list, which only they can access.  

If you're interested in using and seeing the app, send me an email.

Sensitive database creds are kept out of this repo for obvious reasons.

Hosted here on my production NodeJS server:

Update: 4-17-2017 - I moved this app to a NodeJS sever, making this app a JavaScript universal app.
